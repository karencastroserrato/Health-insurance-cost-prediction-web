# About this project 

Health Insurance Cost Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to help insurance companies determine what the costs are for a person with certain features. The predictions are based on the modeling carried out with the features of each person included in the data set. 

Below you will find the attributes of each person studied:
- Age
- Sexy
- BMI (Body mass index)
- Children
- Smoker
- Region
- Charges

The data was obtained through Kaggle.

Several predictive models were applied and evaluated to determine which model has the lowest margin of error, that is, the one that best fits the problem.

ðŸ¤“ðŸ¦¾ The goal is to accurately predict the cost of insurance based on people's data ðŸ¦¾ðŸ¤“

### Streamlit library

In addition to the predictive analysis, this project contains a development implemented with the Streamlit library.

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps.
